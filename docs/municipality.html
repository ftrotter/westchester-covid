<p>Westchester County does not currently publish historical data at the municipal-level, but I have reconstructed this data using maps <a href="https://twitter.com/westchestergov/status/1336045976981811206">posted on the WestchesterGov Twitter account</a>. The earliest maps that included the number of active cases by municipality were posted in early May. As such, the data I have <em>largely misses the first wave of the pandemic</em> from March and April 2020.</p>
<aside>
Because of the unavailability of this historical data from the County, caution should be used when interpreting municipal-level trends.
</aside>
<p>The chart below shows the severity of the pandemic in each municipality by plotting the rolling 14-day average of new cases per 100,000 residents by day. The municipalities are ordered from top to bottom by their current average daily cases per 100,000.</p>
<aside>
For days with missing data, I have imputed the case numbers using linear interpolation.

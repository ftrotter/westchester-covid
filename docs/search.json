The Westchester County Department of Health website does not provide much data or detailed information about the state of the pandemic in the county, so this site hopes to fill the gap.\r\nData sources\r\nNew York State Statewide Covid-19 Testing\r\nNew York State Department of Health\r\nThis dataset includes the number of tests and positive cases of Covid-19 in New York State. The data is reported by county. It is updated daily and includes all tests reported by the end of the prior day. Tests include those administered by clinical laboratories as well as pooled or batch tests reported by colleges and universities.\r\nTests are assigned to a county based on the patient’s address. If that cannot be determined, the address of the health care provider who ordered the test is used.\r\nIf a person has multiple specimens tested on the same day, they are only counted as one test. If a person is tested on multiple days, each day’s test will be counted separately. An individual will only be counted positive one time, regardless of the number of positive tests that individual has.\r\nMost recent data: Dec 22, 2020  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: County (New York State only)  Where it’s used: New and total tests, new and total cases, test positivity rate\r\n\r\nCoronavirus (Covid-19) Data in the United States\r\nThe New York Times\r\nThis dataset includes the number of cases and deaths due to Covid-19 in the United States. The data is reported by county. It is updated daily and includes all cases and deaths compiled by Times journalists by the end of the prior day. The data is based on reports from state and local health agencies across the county and each state may have a slightly different reporting methodology.\r\nFor counties in New York State, the Times uses data reported by the NYS Department of Health. There is a one-day lag in the NYS data in the Times dataset. For example, data counted on December 16 by the New York Times was reported on December 15 by NYSDOH.\r\nBeginning August 6, the methodology for assigning deaths to counties in New York State was modified. Currently, deaths are assigned to the county of residence. Before August 6, deaths were assigned to county in which the death took place.\r\nMost recent data: Dec 22, 2020  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: County (United States)  Where it’s used: New and total deaths, new and total cases (metro area)\r\n\r\nCovid-19 Confirmed Cases\r\nWestchester County Department of Health\r\nThis dataset includes the number of Covid-19 cases in each of the 43 municipalities of Westchester County. It is updated on (most) weekdays and includes all cases in which a positive coronavirus test is associated with a confirmed address in Westchester County. With each update, the County posts the number of new cases, active cases, and total cases per municipality. The number of “active cases” refers the number of positive tests in the past two weeks.\r\nOften, the data reported by the county differs significantly from the data reported by NYSDOH. Given the lack of information shared by the Westchester County Department of Health about this data, I only use the County data to compare municipalities within Westchester. The data released by the County should not be directly compared to data released by the State or other sources.\r\nUnfortunately, the County does not currently post historical data, but rather posts a map on most weekdays to the WestchesterGov Twitter account. Because of this limitation, I have extracted this historical data from maps that are posted on Twitter. This extraction process is imperfect but until the county releases more accurate historical data, this is best I can do. Beginning on December 3, 2020, I began scraping the daily data from the Westchester County website, which results in more reliable data. Because of the unavailability of this historical data from the County, extreme caution should be used when looking at municipal-level trends.\r\nGiven these limitations, I have decided to use the “active cases” metric as rolling 14-day average for most of the municipal-level on this site, as it seems to be the best balance between accuracy and recency If you or anyone you know works for the County, please encourage them to release more detailed historical data!\r\nMost recent data: Dec 23, 2020  Update frequency: Weekdays (usually)  Geographic aggregation: Municipality (Westchester County only)  Where it’s used: New and total cases\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 Reported Patient Impact and Hospital Capacity by Facility\r\nUnited States Department of Health and Human Services\r\nThis dataset includes capacity and utilization of hospitals in the United States. It is reported on a weekly basis and provides facility-level information such as the number of total inpatient and ICU beds, the number of inpatient and ICU beds currently occupied, and the number of Covid-19 patients currently admitted to each hospital facility.\r\nThe data is derived from reports made by hospitals and state health departments to HHS. It includes hospitals registered with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, but does not include psychiatric, rehabilitation, Indian Health Service (IHS) facilities, U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) facilities, Defense Health Agency (DHA) facilities, and religious non-medical facilities.\r\nOn this site, I use weekly average figures reported by the HHS dataset. In other words, this data is not a snapshot of hospital occupancy on a given day, but rather the average occupancy over the report week.\r\nHospital metric definitions:\r\nCovid-19 patients: patients currently hospitalized in an inpatient bed who have laboratory-confirmed or suspected Covid-19, including those in observation beds\r\nTotal beds: staffed inpatient beds including all overflow and active surge/expansion beds used for inpatients (including all designated ICU beds)\r\nBeds used: staffed inpatient beds that are occupied\r\nBed occupancy: beds used divided by total beds\r\nTotal ICU beds: staffed inpatient ICU beds\r\nICU beds used: staffed inpatient ICU beds that are occupied\r\nBed occupancy: ICU beds used divided by total ICU beds\r\nMost recent data: Dec 11, 2020 – Dec 18, 2020  Update frequency: Weekly  Geographic aggregation: None (facility-level data, United States)  Where it’s used: Hospital capacity, occupancy, Covid-19 patients\r\n\r\nNew York State Micro-Cluster Strategy\r\nNew York State Forward\r\nThe state publishes geographic boundaries of each micro-cluster along with recent 7-day average positivity rates for each cluster. Unfortunately, this data is not easily accessible, so I scrape this data on a regular basis from the state’s hot spot address map. The creation and update of zones does not appear to be a on a regular schedule.\r\nMost recent data: Dec 16, 2020  Update frequency: Sporadic  Geographic aggregation: None  Where it’s used: New York State micro-clusters\r\n\r\nNursing Home and ACF COVID Related Deaths Statewide\r\nNew York State Department of Health\r\nThis dataset includes the cumulative number of confirmed and presumed Covid-19 deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities in New York State. Importantly, it only includes deaths that occurred in nursing home facilities. If a nursing home resident died in a hospital, it is not counted as a nursing home death. Because of this limitation, the number of nursing homes deaths is undercounted in these numbers. There has been significant press coverage of this issue, and hopefully the state will respond by releasing more detailed information related to Covid-19 in nursing homes.\r\nThe number of beds in each nursing home comes from NYS Health Profiles.\r\nMost recent data: Dec 21, 2020  Update frequency: Daily  Geographic aggregation: None (facility-level data, New York State)  Where it’s used: Deaths in nursing homes\r\n\r\nAmerican Community Survey\r\nUS Census Bureau\r\nTo calculate per capita rates of Covid-19, I use estimates of total population from the American Community Survey (table B01003). County per capita rates are calculated using 2019 1-year ACS estimates. Municipality rates are calculated using 2015 – 2019 5-year ACS estimates.\r\nWhere it’s used: Per capita case rates\r\nMe\r\nThis website was built and is maintained by me, Matt Herman. I live in Katonah, NY. Contact me at mfherman@gmail.com with comments, questions, or suggestions.\r\nTools, etc.\r\nThis website is built using the Distill framework for R Markdown. All data collection and aggregation is done using the R programming language. The interactive charts are made with Plotly, maps are made with Leaflet, and tables are made with DataTables. The static HTML is hosted by GitHub Pages.\r\nAll source code for downloading and aggregating the data as well as building the website is available on GitHub.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

By contrast, other counties such as New Haven, Fairfield, Litchfield, had relatively mild first waves in the spring and more severe second waves in fall 2020. The chart below shows the number of cases per 100,000 residents from March 2020 through the present in each county.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew York State micro-clusters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Cuomo announced a “micro-cluster strategy” in October 2020, in which small geographic areas are targeted with enhanced restrictions on gatherings, indoor dining, and other activities.

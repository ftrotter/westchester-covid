This website contains information about the Covid-19 pandemic in Westchester County, NY. The [Westchester County Department of Health website](https://health.westchestergov.com/2019-novel-coronavirus) does not contain much data or detailed information about the state of the pandemic in the county, so this website hopes to fill the gap.

## About the data

Westchester County does not currently post historical data with the number of new cases per day by municipality. Because of this limitation, I have attempted to extract this historical data from maps that are posted each weekday to the [WestchesterGov Twitter account](https://twitter.com/westchestergov/status/1336045976981811206). This extraction processes is imperfect but until the county releases more accurate historical data, this is best I can do. Starting on December 3, 2020, I began scraping this data each day from the [Westchester County website](https://westchestergov.com/covid-19-cases), which results in significantly more reliable data.

In addition to the data scraped from the county, I also download Westchester data from the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) and the [New York State Department of Health](https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e). Each of these data sources reports data at the county-level only. New York Times data contains daily cases and deaths. New York State Department of Health data contains daily cases and daily tests.

The data scraped from the county as well as New York State and New York Times data is available in this [GithHub repository](https://github.com/mfherman/westchester-covid/tree/master/data). It is updated daily as new data is reported and is the source data for the tables, charts, and maps contained on this website.
